# Dockerised Development Environment

_do you ever get the impression you're making things difficult for yourself?_

I am not a big fan of all the customisations and overlaps of various programming languages required to do my work so why not break it all down and learn some docker along the way.

I am using a Debian VM to work in so theres even less messing around required with path and environment variables in general.

I have two folders in my home directory, `gitrepos` and `containers`. All the websites or code goes in `gitrepos` and a copy of the files and folders here go in the `containers` directory with a couple of real world tweaks.

This is mostly a collection of notes so I wouldn't be surprised if I force pushed some changes and tidied up a bit more but I wanted to get it documented so I could test building from scratch again.

I've ended up hardcoding more than a few `/home/wh`'s so your best bet is to take a copy and make all the changes you want and then commit it to your own repo. Sozlol.
